The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:


1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221


1 is read off as &quot;one 1&quot; or 11.
11 is read off as &quot;two 1s&quot; or 21.
21 is read off as &quot;one 2, then one 1&quot; or 1211.

Given an integer n&nbsp;where 1 &le; n &le; 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:


Input: 1

Example 2:


Input: 4
Output: &quot;1211&quot;
